# Project guidelines

## Introduction

This document describes the guidelines for the project. It is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves.

## Project goals

## Project structure

op-ent is build following a modular approach. Parts that can be extracted/abstracted into separate projects will be. Therefore, the project is split into several repositories already. Some examples:

- [op-ent/api](https://github.com/op-ent/api) holds the project backend (REST/GraphQL API)
- [op-ent/dashboard](https://github.com/op-ent/dashboard) hold the project frontend (dashboard)
- [op-ent/unstyled-ui](https://github.com/op-ent/unstyled-ui) holds an headless component library, used in the dashboard

## Project scope

Depending on its parts, the project has different scopes:

- internal (op-ent focused) parts target French people (i.e the dashboard)
- external (global usage) parts target the world (i.e `unstyled-ui`)

## Language

Even if op-ent targets a French audience, by its modular nature not all parts only aims at French developers. Therefore, depending on the repository's scope, the language used for documentation & GitHub interactions (issues, pull requests and so on) won't be the same. Let's see examples:

- [op-ent/api](https://github.com/op-ent/api) is a part of software that is only meant to be used internally, so it has to be written in French. Moreover, contributors will probably be part of the Frencg school system so it makes sense.
- [op-ent/unstyled-ui](https://github.com/op-ent/unstyled-ui) is a part of software that is meant to be shared as an NPM package, so it has to be written in English.
- This repository can be read by anyone as its acts as a global guideline for the project (including all sub parts), so it has to be written in English.

In all cases, commits and code (comments, variable names, etc.) must be written in English.
